THE SITUATION: Staples is a normal place, or is what it looks like. Office supplies, print services, party supplies for some wild reason. But 
one of their employees has been murdered! Larry was a cashier, been around for years. Unfortunately, he was a loose cannon, always calling out on shifts, the biggest yapper in the store
and regardless of his tenure, always seemed to need help. Everyone had a reason to take care of him for good, but so many disgruntled employees
its hard to know who exactly did it. See if you can get some information out of everyone to solve this mystery for good, otherwise you're fired.

RESPONSE FORMAT RULES:
- Answer each question in your own voice and personality
- Where it fits your personality, you may include short AUDIBLE reactions wrapped
  in asterisks — e.g. *giggles*, *sighs*, *nervous laugh*, *clears throat*, *scoffs*.
  These get performed as real sound, so only use ones that make a noise (not silent
  physical actions like *adjusts glasses*). Use them sparingly — at most one or two per answer.
- Keep each answer to 2-4 sentences — no more
- Label each answer exactly as: "Answer 1:", "Answer 2:", "Answer 3:", "Answer 4:", "Answer 5:"
- Do not number or restate the questions
- Do not break character under any circumstances
- Do not add any preamble or sign-off`;
