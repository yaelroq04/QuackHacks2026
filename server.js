//  - one subtle piece of physical evidence that points to the real killer
//  - where each suspect ACTUALLY was (their true location)
//  - 5 fresh interrogation questions
// The player never sees the killer's identity or the suspects' true locations;
// they only see the body location + the evidence clue in the CASE FILE.
// Suspect tapes are then generated FROM this truth so innocents corroborate
// and the killer's lie clashes with the evidence + the others.

The victim is Larry Misaras, a long-time cashier — a loud, frequently-absent loose cannon
that many coworkers resented.

THE SUSPECTS:
${suspectRoster}

THE REAL KILLER for THIS case is: ${killerId} (${killer.name}, ${killer.occupation}).

Invent a fresh, self-consistent ground truth for this specific case. Return ONLY valid JSON
(no markdown, no code fences) with EXACTLY this shape:

{
  "bodyLocation": "<one of the rooms above — where Larry's body was found>",
  "summary": "<2-3 sentence description of what really happened the night of the murder, consistent with the killer being ${killer.name}>",
  "evidence": "<ONE subtle piece of physical evidence found at/near the body that quietly points to the killer WITHOUT naming them — e.g. a smudge of toner, a specific item, a sound someone heard. It should be a clue a sharp detective could connect to the killer's role/location, never an outright giveaway>",
  "questions": ["<question 1>", "<question 2>", "<question 3>", "<question 4>", "<question 5>"],
  "locations": {
    "suspect_1": "<room this suspect was truly in>",

    "suspect_6": "<room>"

RULES:
- The killer (${killerId}) must truly have been in or near the "bodyLocation" room, OR their true location must conflict with the evidence so a detective can catch them.
- Innocent suspects' true locations should be consistent with each other so their stories corroborate.
- At least one innocent suspect's true location should let them corroborate or clear another innocent, and at least one should be able to cast subtle suspicion toward the killer's area.
- The 5 questions should be natural interrogation questions (about whereabouts that night, the victim, suspicious activity, motive, and daily routine) but freshly worded for this case.
- Keep the evidence subtle — it hints, it does not announce.
- Output JSON only.`;

THE SITUATION: Staples is a normal place, or is what it looks like. Office supplies, print services, party supplies for some wild reason. But
one of their employees has been murdered! Larry was a cashier, been around for years. Unfortunately, he was a loose cannon, always calling out on shifts, the biggest yapper in the store
and regardless of his tenure, always seemed to need help. Everyone had a reason to take care of him for good, but so many disgruntled employees
its hard to know who exactly did it. See if you can get some information out of everyone to solve this mystery for good, otherwise you're fired.

RESPONSE FORMAT RULES:
- Answer each question in your own voice and personality
- Where it fits your personality, you may include short AUDIBLE reactions wrapped
  in asterisks — e.g. *giggles*, *sighs*, *nervous laugh*, *clears throat*, *scoffs*.
  These get performed as real sound, so only use ones that make a noise (not silent
  physical actions like *adjusts glasses*). Use them sparingly — at most one or two per answer.
- Keep each answer to 2-4 sentences — no more
- Label each answer exactly as: "Answer 1:", "Answer 2:", "Answer 3:", "Answer 4:", "Answer 5:"
- Do not number or restate the questions
- Do not break character under any circumstances
- Do not add any preamble or sign-off`;
