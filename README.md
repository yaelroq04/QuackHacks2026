# Missing Staple— A Murder Mystery Detective Game

> **A Hackathon Project for [Quack Hacks 2026](https://quackhacks.org)**

---

## Overview

**Missing Staple** is a browser-based murder mystery game inspired by the classic board game *Clue*. Players step into the role of a detective tasked with solving a murder by reviewing pre-recorded interrogation tapes of 5 suspects. Using an in-game notepad, players cross-reference answers, identify contradictions, and make their accusation — before the killer gets away.

Each playthrough is powered by **Gemini & Eleven Labs** — every suspect has their own unique personality and is dynamically generated fresh each game, meaning no two playthroughs are ever the same.

## How It Works

1. **A murder has been committed.** You receive the case file with the victim's profile and the crime scenario.
2. **Five suspects have been recorded.** Pull up each suspect's interrogation tape and listen to their answers to the same 5 questions.
3. **Take notes.** Use the built-in detective notepad to jot down inconsistencies and cross-reference what suspects say about each other.
4. **Ask One Final Question.** Ask one final question for all suspects to answer, be aware of their behavior.
5. **Make your accusation.** When you're confident you've found the killer — point the finger. But choose wisely.
